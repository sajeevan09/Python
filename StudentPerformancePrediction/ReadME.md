Project Overview

This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on factors like study hours, attendance, and test scores. It uses Python and a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) to make predictions


Tools & Libraries

Python 3

pandas – for data manipulation

scikit-learn – for machine learning

matplotlib – for data visualization


Features

Predict if a student will pass or fail

Train a machine learning model on sample data

Test the model and show accuracy and confusion matrix

Visualize student performance in a scatter plot


Dataset

The project uses a small sample dataset included in the code:

Hours Studied

Attendance (%)

Test Score

Passed (0 = Fail, 1 = Pass)

You can replace it with a larger dataset from Kaggle to improve the model.
